## Summary
This module provides access to the native iOS Apply Pay PassKit Framework. Using this module, you can 
easily accept Apple Pay payments using Titanium Mobile. The currently supported payment gateways are [Stripe](https://stripe.com)
and [Braintree](https://braintreepayments.com), which are recommended by Apple to process payments easily.

## Features
The following features are covered:
- [x] Payment Button
- [x] Payment Request
- [x] Payment Dialog
- [x] Payment backend-gateway using Stripe

## Requirements
- [x] Titanium Mobile SDK 6.2.2.GA or later
- [x] Xcode 8 or later
- [x] iOS 9 or later

## Setup
Unpack the module and place it inside the /modules/iphone folder of your project. 
Edit the modules section of your tiapp.xml file to include this module:
```xml
<modules>
    <module platform="iphone">ti.applepay</module>
</modules>
```

After that, you create an instance of the module by requiring it:
```js
var ApplePay = require('ti.applepay');
```

Before you can start using the many different API's, you need to configure the module 
by providing a Stripe / Braintree API-Key (from here). The gateways are determined using constants
to keep the module open for more payment gateways added in feature releases. 
The configuration looks like this:
```js
ApplePay.setupPaymentGateway({
  name: ApplePay.PAYMENT_GATEWAY_STRIPE, // or: ApplePay.PAYMENT_GATEWAY_BRAINTREE
  apiKey: '<YOUR_STRIPE_OR_BRAINTREE_API_KEY>'
});
```
You also need the Entitlements.plist with the merchant group's you want to assign. 
A full tutorial on how to setup the merchant ID's in the developer center can be found [here](https://github.com/hansemannn/applepaydemo).
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>com.apple.developer.in-app-payments</key>
	<array>
		<string>merchant.de.hansknoechel.paydemo.stripe</string>
		<string>merchant.de.hansknoechel.paydemo.braintree</string>
		<string>merchant.de.hansknoechel.paydemo.chase</string>
	</array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

(Optionally), you can create an 'Apple Pay styled' button by providing the type and style:
```js
var payButton = ApplePay.createPaymentButton({
    type: ApplePay.PAYMENT_BUTTON_TYPE_BUY,
    style: ApplePay.PAYMENT_BUTTON_STYLE_WHITE_OUTLINE
});
payButton.addEventListener('click', openPaymentDialog);
```

Make sure to check if ApplePay is set-up by using the `ApplePay.canMakePayments(args)` method or 
display the `ApplePay.openPaymentSetup()`  to let the user setup new cards. Now you're able to setup 
the payment request using `ApplePay.createPaymentRequest(args)`:
```js
var paymentRequest = ApplePay.createPaymentRequest({
    merchantIdentifier: 'merchant.com.company.appname',
    merchantCapabilities: ApplePay.MERCHANT_CAPABILITY_3DS | ApplePay.MERCHANT_CAPABILITY_CREDIT | ApplePay.MERCHANT_CAPABILITY_DEBIT | ApplePay.MERCHANT_CAPABILITY_EMV,
    countryCode: 'US',
    currencyCode: 'USD',
    billingContact: contact,
    shippingContact: contact,
    supportedNetworks: [ApplePay.PAYMENT_NETWORK_VISA, ApplePay.PAYMENT_NETWORK_MASTERCARD],
    requiredShippingAddressFields: ApplePay.ADDRESS_FIELD_POSTAL_ADDRESS,
    requiredBillingAddressFields: ApplePay.ADDRESS_FIELD_POSTAL_ADDRESS,
    shippingType: ApplePay.SHIPPING_TYPE_DELIVERY,
    shippingMethods: shippingMethods,
    summaryItems: summaryItems,
    applicationData: {
        userId: 1337
    }
});
```

Although most properties are self-describing, you can find all properties in the official 
Apple documentation as well, in addition to the detailed code documentation following in 
the next chapter.

To actually show the payment dialog, you can use the ApplePay.createPaymentDialog method:
```js
var paymentDialog = ApplePay.createPaymentDialog({
    paymentRequest: paymentRequest
});
paymentDialog.show();
```

There are a couple of payment events you need to implement to respond to changes made in 
the payment dialog and to finish a payment:
```js
paymentDialog.addEventListener('didSelectPayment', didSelectPayment);
paymentDialog.addEventListener('didSelectShippingContact', didSelectShippingContact);
paymentDialog.addEventListener('didSelectShippingMethod', didSelectShippingMethod);
paymentDialog.addEventListener('willAuthorizePayment', didAuthorizePayment);
paymentDialog.addEventListener('didAuthorizePayment', willAuthorizePayment);
paymentDialog.addEventListener('close', willClose);

function didSelectPayment(e) {
    e.handler.complete(paymentRequest.getSummaryItems());
}

function didSelectShippingContact(e) {
    e.handler.complete(ApplePay.PAYMENT_AUTHORIZATION_STATUS_SUCCESS, paymentRequest.getShippingMethods(), paymentRequest.getSummaryItems());
}

function didSelectShippingMethod(e) {
    e.handler.complete(ApplePay.PAYMENT_AUTHORIZATION_STATUS_SUCCESS, paymentRequest.getSummaryItems());
}

function willAuthorizePayment() {
  // Do amazing stuff here, before the payment is authorized.
}

function didAuthorizePayment(e) {
    // ... Send the encrypted payment data to your backend
    Ti.API.info('Payment successfully authorized: ' + e.success);
    
    e.handler.complete(ApplePay.PAYMENT_AUTHORIZATION_STATUS_SUCCESS);
}
```

The handler needs to call complete to tell the payment dialog to continue processing. For example, 
you can change the shipping costs depending on the selected shipping contact or decline a payment 
if your backend could not be reached. 

This makes the module as flexible as it needs to be to 
handle even advanced payments. An example of using the module in a real-world-application can be 
found in `example/app.js`.
